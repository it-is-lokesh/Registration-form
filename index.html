                Machine Learning is increasingly becoming mainstream as young and established companies are adding AI tools increasingly to their business operations. The challenges remain as AI is still seen by many as an unapproachable beast that requires deep mathematical research skills, solid engineering skills, and great software programming skills. While to a certain extent this may be true, the ecosystem is also becoming accessible to non-tech people allowing anyone with a great idea to be able to set up a startup by themselves. Witness how the big bang disruption is happening in the field of AI by AI and what you should pay attention to when planning your startup.
